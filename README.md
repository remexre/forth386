forth386
========

A bare-metal Forth for i386 machines. Boots via Multiboot 2. Assumes a PS/2 keyboard (or PS/2 emulation), and relatively modern hardware otherwise.

Note that this does not follow the ANS Forth standard.

Based on http://www.bradrodriguez.com/papers/moving1.htm -- read it before hacking.
